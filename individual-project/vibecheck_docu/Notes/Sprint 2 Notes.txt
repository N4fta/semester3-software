Regarding the Design Document:
- In the C2 diagram I should change the name of my Java+Spring component
- The reasoning for each tech choice should include more specific examples of each SOLID principle
- Add the MySQL tech choice reasons

Regarding the Front-end:
- Apply more SOLID principles, for example extracting API calls to their own layer

From the other participants:
- Add more alternatives to reasoning in SAD choices
- I should mind Restful API practices and have appropriate endpoints & parameters

Other Notes:
I should keep implementing features as by sprint 5 we need a fully functional MVP.
