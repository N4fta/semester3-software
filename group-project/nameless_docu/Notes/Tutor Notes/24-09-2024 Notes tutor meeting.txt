24-09-2024 Summary Notes from the tutor meeting:

- Our research questions in the project plan are okay
- We can add more user stories later in the project
- We should send the project plan to the client and submit it on Canvas once we are fully done.
- Our research document is good but we should add DOT framework (triangles)
	- Which 3 components are used for each research
	- how and where are we using, which strategies we chose
- Problem statement, project goal, deliverables and non-deliverables are important
- For adding more tasks - make requirements, prioritize them, put in the backlog
- We can make a list of requirements in a way we prefer.
	- After prioritizing put in the backlog. 
	- Make product backlog
- User stories should be more customer-oriented, not technical
- It would be nice to make the project backlog until next week
- We can use BAS World's logo and colour scheme
