30-09-2024 Summary Notes from the tutor meeting:

Show dashboard in presentation, Jira is not required
No technical stuff in presentation
It isn't required to show endpoint to the client (we can ask client whether it is okay to show technical stuff to him)
We have to tell client what is our goal and deliverables
Depending on feedback of client, we should make corresponding changes
Submit on friday
User stories should be in project plan (screenshot/copy-paste, not link to Jira) - or we can make separate document for that
Requirements in Jira (features)
First context, then problem statement and then the goal
Put MoSCoW table in Project plan after end products - it will count as user requirements
What we will do for him
Explain what type of data and how we want to show it
