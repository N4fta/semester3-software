16-09-2024 Summary Notes from the tutor meeting:

- We need to explain what software we are going to use?
- The Research questions can be both - professional and technical
- We need to have at least 3 and at most 5 research questions
- In the project plan we should only name the research question and the way we will research it. 
- All the descriptions of the research questions should be in a separate document 
- Structure of research document:
  Introduction
  First question
  Resources
  All the solutions proposed
  The chosen solution and why was it chosen
- We have to implement event handling in the first sprint
- The tutor should be invited to Jira
- At the end of the sprint we should ask the client whether he wants to be invited to GIT/Jira
- The context paragraph in project plan should be more about the project and not the team
- The phasing has to be modified with all the sprint added to it
