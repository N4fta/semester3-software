19/11/2024 - Summary

- Notes from our presentation:
	- AWS not Azure
	- Filtering options (endpoints and in widgets)
	- Live Feed
	- Polish
	- Time filter for whole dashboard
	- Do we NEED web sockets?
	- Should we keep the testing button?
	- Generator Test button
	- Docker Compose
	- Send Walking skeleton and other documentation
	- **We should send the code at the end of the project**

- Notes from the client meeting:
	- The way data is presented are okay
	- Better generator (x1-1000)/show incoming events
	- Walking skeleton is too technical
	- Presentation on how we build the app, our struggles, etc. How it works
		- We need to show you can trust our logic
		- Add event is a black box (Explain it)
		- Generator should show events generating
		- 
	- Copy/Paste data from BAS website as Demo
	- it's better to sort sidebar based on topic
	- Client needs to trust the application and the data
	- If we host everything in Docker and AWS, notes would be appreciated
	- 
	- End goal, make it come alive for sales people
		- Simple graphs are better for understanding by business people
		- So we should have more graphs that could be interesting sales people
	- We shouldn't focus on it too much
	- Architectural Document would be good
